## Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the music store's operations by answering specific questions using SQL queries. The database contains information about employees, customers, invoices, tracks, and more. By querying this data, we can uncover valuable information about the store's performance and customer preferences.

   We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city where we made the most money. Write a query that returns the city with the highest sum of invoice totals, including the city name and the sum of all invoice totals.
5. **Who is the best customer?**  
   The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.
